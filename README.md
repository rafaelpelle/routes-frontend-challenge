## Explaining some decisions:
- In the Home page, the data flow is controlled by custom hooks. In the Results page, the data flow is controlled by Redux/Sagas. This pattern mismatch is intentional, to present 2 different skills.

- I've used a licensed favicon, and it's necessary to give credits to the author. That's why there's a link on the bottom of every page (as instructed by FlatIcon).
